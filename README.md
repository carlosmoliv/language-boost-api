<h1 align="center">Language Boost API (under construction)</h1>

## :bulb: About the project

An API for a language learning platform that I'm developing from scratch for study purposes.

My approach involves applying TDD, Clean Architecture, Clean Code, Design Patterns, and SOLID principles. I'm adhering to the Classic School of TDD (also known as Detroit/Chicago), focusing on testing behavior rather than implementation details. This project aims to enhance my understanding of best practices in software development.

Regarding the test strategy, influenced by the Classical School and drawing insights from Vladimir Korikov's book, I'll opt for targeted mocking. This means I'll only mock when necessary, specifically in situations involving unmanaged out-of-process dependencies like SMTP and Payment gateways.

Functionalities roadmap:
- Authentication
  - Login
  - Student Registration (Three steps Onboarding)
  - Tutor Registration
- Email verification
- Student Profile
- Tutor Profile
- Lesson Scheduling
- Payment features

Nice to have in the future:
- Add live video and real-time chat capabilities, instead of just sharing external links like Zoom or Google Meet.
- Signin/Signup using other methods such as Apple, Google, Facebook
