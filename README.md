## :bulb: About the project

My approach involves applying Test-Driven Development (TDD), Clean Architecture, Clean Code, Design Patterns, and SOLID principles. I'm adhering to the Classic School of TDD (also known as Detroit/Chicago), focusing on testing behavior rather than implementation details. This project aims to enhance my understanding of best practices in software development.
